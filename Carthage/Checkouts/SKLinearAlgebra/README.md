# SKLinearAlgebra
[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/apexskier/SKLinearAlgebra.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/apexskier/SKLinearAlgebra)


This library allows common vector operations using SceneKit's
[native types](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SceneKit_DataTypes/): 
`SCNVector3`, `SCNVector4`, and `SCNMatrix4`. It also provides useful
linear algebra functions for 3D graphics.

It has been written in the style of Swift, intending to enhance and complete 
Scenekit's existing
[functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SceneKit_Functions/).

## Features

Tests are complete for all implemented features.

### Operations

- equality (`==`)
- inequality (`!=`)
- equivalence (`~=`)
  - Returns true if the components are close to equal to each other.
- inequivalence (`!~=`)
- addition (`+`, `+=`)
- subtraction (`-`, `-=`)
- dot product (`*`)
- scalar multiplication (`*`, `*=`)
- scalar division (`/`, `/=`)
- cross product (`Ã—`)
- subscript access (`v[0]`, `m[1, 2]`)
  - Zero based indexing
  - Access by [row, column]

### Functions

- cross product (`cross(a: Vector, b: Vector)`)
- magnitude (`magnitude(v: Vector)`)
- normalize (`normalize(v: Vector)`)
- angle between (`angle(a: Vector, b: Vector)`)
- component (`component(a: Vector, b: Vector)`) - comp_{b} a
  - Read this as "the component of a onto b", it would be written comp_{b} a.
- projection (`projection(a: Vector, b: Vector)`)
  - Read this as "the projection of a onto b", it would be written proj_{b} a
- determinate (`det(m: Matrix)`)
- transpose (`transpose(m: Matrix)`)
- inverse (`inverse(m: Matrix)`)

## Usage

The documentation for using a custom Swift library is lacking at the moment, but
my process has been as follows:

1. Clone `git@github.com:apexskier/SKLinearAlgebra.git` into your project directory.
2. Drag `SKLinearAlgebra.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.
4. Select your project, select your target, under General find "Linked Frameworks and Libraries".
3. Add `SKLinearAlgebra.framework`, either from the + button or by dragging in `SKLinearAlgebra/Products/SKLinearAlgebra.framework` from the project navigator.

```Swift
// Example import statements

import SceneKit
import SKLinearAlgebra

let vector = SCNVector4(x: 1, y: 2, z: 3, w: 4)
vector *= 4
println(vector)
```

## Future Plans

- Some kind of support for bases (origin + 3 vectors)
  - Conversion between basis
- Use specific type aliases
  - Vectors for colors, locations, directions, rotations
- Rotation utilities
- Torque and Force utilities
- Utilize [Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/) or [Surge](https://github.com/mattt/Surge)
